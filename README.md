Bakground: The goal of this excercise is to investigate theoretically and experimentally how the dynamical properties of a map or di erential equation depend on the system parameters.

<ol>

 <li>For <em>a </em>and <em>b </em>real parameters, consider the HØnon map:</li>

</ol>

(   2 <em>x</em><em>n</em>+1 = 1+ <em>y</em><em>n </em>− <em>ax</em><em>n</em>

<em>y</em><em>n</em>+1 = <em>bx</em><em>n</em>

Question 1 Where in (<em>b,a</em>)-plane do xed points exist? Compute the region of stability in (<em>b,a</em>)-plane where at least one xed point is stable. See a detailed hint at the end of this list.

Question 2 Let <em>b </em>= 0<em>.</em>3 throughout and investigate (numerically) what happens when <em>a </em>varies from 0 to 3.

Question 3 For <em>b </em>= 0<em>.</em>3, build up the so-called bifurcation diagram by plotting the <em>x </em>variable of the stationary solution against the parameter <em>a</em>. Plot just points, not lines joining the points.

 <li>For the di erential equation:</li>

</ol>

Question 4 (a) Find the           xed point. Compute its stability region in (<em>b,a</em>)plane. (b) For which (<em>b,a</em>)-values the system has a periodic orbit? Where is it stable? (Hint: Use polar coordinates).

Question 5 (a) Plot a few orbits of the system for <em>a </em>= 1 to get an idea of the overall dynamics. (b) Same for <em>a </em>= −1.

Question 6 Let <em>a </em>= <em>b </em>= 1 and nd a trapping region. Note that in this case the origin is unstable, so you need to nd a large region of phase space such that the ow points inwards on the surface of the region.

<h1>Hint to stability part of Question 1</h1>

<ol>

 <li>First compute the <em>x</em>-coordinate of the xed points <em>x</em><sub>±</sub>. Note that for <em>a &gt; </em>0 both xed points have di erent signs on their <em>x</em>-coordinate.</li>

 <li>Compute the jacobian as a function of <em>x</em><sub>±</sub>, note Trace and Determinant.</li>

 <li>Appendix A.4.6.2(b) Compute the necessary condition for sability interms of <em>b</em>.</li>

 <li>Compute the eigenvalues of xed points in terms of <em>x</em>:</li>

</ol>

<em>λ<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) = −<em>ax </em>+ ···.

<ol start="5">

 <li>To get stability, in addition to the necessary condition on <em>b</em>, it is required that the eigenvalue of largest modulus for at least one xed point satis es |<em>λ<sub>MAX</sub></em>(<em>x</em>)| <em>&lt; </em>1. The border of the stability region is |<em>λ<sub>MAX</sub></em>(<em>x</em>)| = 1.</li>

 <li>You get two conditions |<em>λ<sub>MAX</sub></em>(<em>x</em><sub>+</sub>)| = 1, |<em>λ<sub>MAX</sub></em>(<em>x</em><sub>−</sub>)| = 1. One of them can be discarded, while the other gives the border of a region in the (<em>a,b</em>)-plane. Check if the relevant part is the interior region or the exterior region (pick one easy point (<em>a</em><sub>0</sub><em>,b</em><sub>0</sub>) and check xed points, stability, eigenvalues, etc.).</li>
